# RaspDAB
An ODR-mmbtools automated DAB+ micro transmitter using Raspberry Pi and EasyDab v2

Nowadays to transmit a DAB+ ensemble requires little more than 
- the OpenDigitalRadio mmbtools software
- a Raspberry Pi, and
- an EasyDAB v2 board

This project aims to provide documentation how to build such a 'micro transmitter' which could be used as the starting point for a low cost DAB+ transmitter for e.g. local radio. It is based on experience from building such a system, starting from getting the Raspbian operating system installed, installing the OpenDigitalRadio programs required, configuring and using these, installing supervisor to enable automatic start up and configuring and using the EasyDAB v2 DAB modulator board.

As I'm not that experienced using Linux there were some unexpected hurdles that I needed to overcome. It might just help others to document how it was done, so it is easier for them.
